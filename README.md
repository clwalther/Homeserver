## Quickstart

Homeserver requires Linux to run on your home internet. For a simple price efficent solution we recommend [Raspberry Pi Zero W 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) or one of the other [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) products.
<br><br>
To setup your Homeserver you need to download the [Homeserver Repository](https://github.com/clwalther/Homeserver). For a quick and easy setup you can just execute the *setup.batch* file. This though is not recommend for systems that already use <i>nginx</i> and <i>mysql</i>, as this will be automaticly installed on your server.

Continuing the setup process you will need to name your homeserver and specify the port.
